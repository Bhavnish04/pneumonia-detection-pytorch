# ðŸ©º Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays using CNN (PyTorch)

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with PyTorch to detect **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images.  
The model is trained on the **Kaggle Chest X-ray Dataset** (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- Input: Chest X-ray image (JPEG/PNG).
- Output: **Normal** or **Pneumonia**.
- Framework: PyTorch + Torchvision.
- Hardware: Runs on Google Colab GPU (recommended).
